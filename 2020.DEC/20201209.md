#Computer Programming
- algorithm is a step by step process
- Computer Programming is a step-by-step set of instructions for a computer
- every computer program is an algorithm
- programming languages allow programmers to develop software
####3 major families of languages
- machine Languages
- Assembly Languages
- High-level Languages: javascript
####Machine Language
- comprised of 1s and 0s
- the native languages of a computer
- difficult to program-one misplaced 1 or 0 will cause the program to fail
####Assembly Languages
- a step towards easier programming
- comprised of a set of elemental commands which are tied to a specific processor
- code needs to be translated to machine language before computer processes it
####High-Level Languages
- syntax of HL languages is similar to English
- Interpreter-executes high level language programs without compilation
- Historically, divide HL languages into two groups
#####Procedural Languages 절차지향
- early high-level languages
- characterized by sequential sets of linear commands.
- focus is on structure
- ex. C, COBOL, Fortran, LISP, Perl, HTML, VBScript 
####Object-Oriented Language(OOP) 객체지향
- programmers code using ‘blueprints’ of data models called classes
- ex. Java, C++, C#, Python, PHP, Javascript …
- ex. DOM is composed with HTML element(object) in JavaScript
