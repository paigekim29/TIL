###1370. Increasing Decreasing String
- https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-decreasing-string/
- Given a string s. You should re-order the string using the following algorithm:
1. Pick the smallest character from s and append it to the result.
2. Pick the smallest character from s which is greater than the last appended character to the result and append it.
3. Repeat step 2 until you cannot pick more characters.
4. Pick the largest character from s and append it to the result.
5. Pick the largest character from s which is smaller than the last appended character to the result and append it.
6. Repeat step 5 until you cannot pick more characters.
7. Repeat the steps from 1 to 6 until you pick all characters from s.

- In each step, If the smallest or the largest character appears more than once you can choose any occurrence and append it to the result.
- Return the result string after sorting s with this algorithm.
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "aaaabbbbcccc"
Output: "abccbaabccba"
Explanation: After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the first iteration, result = "abc"
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the first iteration, result = "abccba"
First iteration is done. Now s = "aabbcc" and we go back to step 1
After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabc"
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabccba"
Example 2:
Input: s = "rat"
Output: "art"
Explanation: The word "rat" becomes "art" after re-ordering it with the mentioned algorithm.
Example 3:
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: "cdelotee"
Example 4:
Input: s = "ggggggg"
Output: "ggggggg"
Example 5:
Input: s = "spo"
Output: "ops"
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 500
s contains only lower-case English letters.

```
```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var sortString = function (s) {
  let countObj = {};
  let result = '';

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (countObj[s[i]] === undefined) {
      countObj[s[i]] = 0;
    }
    countObj[s[i]] += 1;
  }

  const aCode = 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
  const zCode = 'z'.charCodeAt(0);
  let sortedArr = Object.keys(countObj);
  for (let start = 0; start < s.length; start++) {
    for (let i = aCode; i <= zCode; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < sortedArr.length; j++) {
        if (countObj[sortedArr[j]] === 0) continue;
        if (String.fromCharCode(i) === sortedArr[j]) {
          result += sortedArr[j]
          countObj[sortedArr[j]]--
        }
      }
    }
    for (let i = zCode; i >= aCode; i--) {
      for (let j = 0; j < sortedArr.length; j++) {
        if (countObj[sortedArr[j]] === 0) continue;
        if (String.fromCharCode(i) === sortedArr[j]) {
          result += sortedArr[j]
          countObj[sortedArr[j]]--
        }
      }
    }

  }

  console.log(countObj)
  return result;
};
console.log(sortString("aaaabbbbcccc"));
```


```js
// munawiki & update by me
/**
 * @param {string} s

var sortString = function (s) {
  const obj = {};
  let result = '';
  let count = s.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (obj[s[i]] === undefined) obj[s[i]] = 0;
    obj[s[i]]++;
  }
  const codeA = 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
  const codeZ = 'z'.charCodeAt(0);

  while (count > 0) {
    for (let i = codeA; i <= codeZ; i++) {
      const str = String.fromCharCode(i);
      if (obj[str] > 0) {
        obj[str]--;
        result += str;
        count--
      }
    }
    for (let i = codeZ; i >= codeA; i--) {
      const str = String.fromCharCode(i);
      if (obj[str] > 0) {
        obj[str]--;
        result += str;
        count--

###1374. Generate a String With Characters That Have Odd Counts
- https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-a-string-with-characters-that-have-odd-counts/
- Given an integer n, return a string with n characters such that each character in such string occurs an odd number of times.
- The returned string must contain only lowercase English letters. If there are multiples valid strings, return any of them.
```js
Example 1:
Input: n = 4
Output: "pppz"
Explanation: "pppz" is a valid string since the character 'p' occurs three times and the character 'z' occurs once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ohhh" and "love".

Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: "xy"
Explanation: "xy" is a valid string since the characters 'x' and 'y' occur once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ag" and "ur".
      
Example 3:
Input: n = 7
Output: "holasss"

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 500
```


```js
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {string}
 */
var generateTheString = function(n) {
    // for loop돌면서 홀수이면 다 a로
    // 짝수이면 0번째 인덱스는 a, 나머지는 b
    let result =''
    for(let i=0; i<n; i++){
        if(n % 2 === 0){
            if(i === 0) result += 'a';
            else result += 'b'
        }else{
            result += 'a';
        }
    }
    return result;
};
```

- https://leetcode.com/problems/count-negative-numbers-in-a-sorted-matrix/
- Given a m * n matrix grid which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise.
- Return the number of negative numbers in grid.
```js
Example 1:
Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,-1],[-1,-1]]
Output: 3

Example 4:
Input: grid = [[-1]]
Output: 1

Constraints:
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100

```

````js
var countNegatives = function (grid) {
  grid = grid.flat(Infinity)
  let count = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
    if (grid[i] < 0) count++

###728. Self Dividing Numbers
- https://leetcode.com/problems/self-dividing-numbers/
- A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.
- For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0, and 128 % 8 == 0.
- Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.
- Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number, including the bounds if possible.
```js
Example 1:
Input:
left = 1, right = 22
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]

Note:
The boundaries of each input argument are 1 <= left <= right <= 10000.
```     


```js
/**
 * @param {number} left
 * @param {number} right
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var selfDividingNumbers = function (left, right) {
  let result = [];

  for (let i = left; i <= right; i++){
    let count =0;
    let num = String(i)
    for(let j= 0; j < num.length; j++){
      if(num % num[j] === 0){
        count ++
      }
      if(count === num.length) result.push(Number(num))
    }
  }
  return result;
};
```

###617. Merge Two Binary Trees
- https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/
- Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.
- You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.
```js
Example 1:
Input:
     Tree 1                     Tree 2                  
      1                         2                             
     / \                       / \                            
    3   2                     1   3                        
   /                           \   \                      
  5                             4   7                  
Output:
Merged tree:
      3
     / \
    4   5 
   / \   \
  5   4   7
```



- Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

```js
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} t1
 * @param {TreeNode} t2
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var mergeTrees = function(t1, t2) {
    if (t1 && t2) {
        const newNode = new TreeNode(t1.val + t2.val);
        newNode.left = mergeTrees(t1.left, t2.left);
        newNode.right = mergeTrees(t1.right, t2.right);
        return newNode;
    } 
    return t1 || t2;
};
```
