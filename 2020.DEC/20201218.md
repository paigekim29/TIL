###905. Sort Array By Parity
- https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity/
- Given an array A of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the even elements of A, followed by all the odd elements of A.
- You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
```js
Example 1:
Input: [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.

Note:
1 <= A.length <= 5000
0 <= A[i] <= 5000
```

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} A
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var sortArrayByParity = function(A) {
    let result =[]
    for(let i = 0; i<A.length; i++){
        if(A[i] % 2 === 0) result.unshift(A[i])
        else{
            result.push(A[i])
        }
    }
    return result
};
```

###1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop
- https://leetcode.com/problems/final-prices-with-a-special-discount-in-a-shop/
- Given the array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop. There is a special discount for items in the shop, if you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i], otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.
- Return an array where the ith element is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop considering the special discount.
```js
Example 1:
Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
Output: [4,2,4,2,3]

Explanation:
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4.
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2.
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4.
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.
    
Example 2:
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: In this case, for all items, you will not receive any discount at all.
      
Example 3:
Input: prices = [10,1,1,6]
Output: [9,0,1,6]
      
Constraints:
1 <= prices.length <= 500
1 <= prices[i] <= 10^3
```
