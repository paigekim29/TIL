## 620. Not Boring Movies

X city opened a new cinema, many people would like to go to this cinema. The cinema also gives out a poster indicating the moviesâ€™ ratings and descriptions.

Please write a SQL query to output movies with an odd numbered ID and a description that is not 'boring'. Order the result by rating.


```js
For example, table cinema:

+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
|   2     | Science   |   fiction    |   8.5     |
|   3     | irish     |   boring     |   6.2     |
|   4     | Ice song  |   Fantacy    |   8.6     |
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
For the example above, the output should be:
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
```

```js
# Write your MySQL query statement below
Select * from cinema WHERE id%2!=0 AND description!='boring' ORDER BY rating DESC
```

## 1380. Lucky Numbers in a Matrix

Given a m * n matrix of distinct numbers, return all lucky numbers in the matrix in any order.

A lucky number is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and maximum in its column.


```js
Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]]
Output: [15]
Explanation: 15 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[1,10,4,2],[9,3,8,7],[15,16,17,12]]
Output: [12]
Explanation: 12 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.
    
Example 3:
Input: matrix = [[7,8],[1,2]]
Output: [7]
```
#### Constraints:
* m == mat.length
* n == mat[i].length
* 1 <= n, m <= 50
* 1 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^5.
* All elements in the matrix are distinct.

```js
/**
 * @param {number[][]} matrix
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var luckyNumbers  = function(matrix) {
    let minArr = [];
    let maxArr = [];
    let max = 0;
    
    for(let i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++){
        minArr.push(Math.min(...matrix[i]));
    }
    
    for(let i = 0; i < matrix[0].length; i++){
        for(let j = 0; j < matrix.length; j++){
            if(matrix[j][i] > max) max = matrix[j][i];
        }
        
        maxArr.push(max);
        max = 0;
    }
    
    return minArr.filter((num) => maxArr.includes(num)); 
    // this allows to check whether same value exists in two arrays
    
};
```

## 821. Shortest Distance to a Character

Given a string s and a character c that occurs in s, return an array of integers answer where answer.length == s.length and answer[i] is the distance from index i to the closest occurrence of character c in s.

The distance between two indices i and j is abs(i - j), where abs is the absolute value function.

```js
Example 1:
Input: s = "loveleetcode", c = "e"
Output: [3,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,0]
Explanation: The character 'e' appears at indices 3, 5, 6, and 11 (0-indexed).
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 0 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 1 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(1 - 3) = 3.
For index 4, there is a tie between the 'e' at index 3 and the 'e' at index 5, but the distance is still the same: abs(4 - 3) == abs(4 - 5) = 1.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 8 is at index 6, so the distance is abs(8 - 6) = 2.

Example 2:
Input: s = "aaab", c = "b"
Output: [3,2,1,0]
```
#### Constraints:
* 1 <= s.length <= 104
* s[i] and c are lowercase English letters.
* It is guaranteed that c occurs at least once in s.
```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {character} c
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var shortestToChar = function(s, c) {
    let indexArr = [];
    
    s.split('').forEach((alphabet, index) => {
        if(alphabet === c) indexArr.push(index)
    }); // find Index of c first
    
    let answer = [];
    
    for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
        answer.push(Math.min(...indexArr.map((index) => Math.abs(index - i))));    
    } // Find minimun index difference using map and absolute number
    
    return answer;
};
```
