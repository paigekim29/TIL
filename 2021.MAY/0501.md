# Algorithm
## 1207. Unique Number of Occurrences
Given an array of integers arr, write a function that returns true if and only if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique.
```js
Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.
    
Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
Output: true
```
#### Constraints:
* 1 <= arr.length <= 1000
* -1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000
```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var uniqueOccurrences = function(arr) {
  let obj = {};

  arr.forEach((num) => {
    obj[num] ? obj[num] ++ : obj[num] = 1
  })

  let valueArr = Object.values(obj);

  let checkLengthArr = new Set(valueArr);

  if(valueArr.length !== checkLengthArr.size) return false;
  return true;
};
```
## 1403. Minimum Subsequence in Non-Increasing Order
Given the array nums, obtain a subsequence of the array whose sum of elements is strictly greater than the sum of the non included elements in such subsequence.

If there are multiple solutions, return the subsequence with minimum size and if there still exist multiple solutions, return the subsequence with the maximum total sum of all its elements. A subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.

Note that the solution with the given constraints is guaranteed to be unique. Also return the answer sorted in non-increasing order.
```js
Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,3,10,9,8]
Output: [10,9]
Explanation: The subsequences [10,9] and [10,8] are minimal such that the sum of their elements is strictly greater than the sum of elements not included, however, the subsequence [10,9] has the maximum total sum of its elements.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,4,7,6,7]
Output: [7,7,6]
Explanation: The subsequence [7,7] has the sum of its elements equal to 14 which is not strictly greater than the sum of elements not included (14 = 4 + 4 + 6). Therefore, the subsequence [7,6,7] is the minimal satisfying the conditions. Note the subsequence has to returned in non-decreasing order.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [6]
Output: [6]
```
#### Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 500
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var minSubsequence = function(nums) {
  nums.sort((a, b) => a- b);
  let maxSum = 0;
  let remainingSum = 0;
  let end = nums.length - 1;
  let answer = [];
  while(maxSum <= remainingSum){
    remainingSum = nums.slice(0, end).reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0);
    maxSum = nums.slice(end).reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0);
    answer.push(nums[end]);
    end --;
  }

  return answer;
};
```

## 98. Validate Binary Search Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.

The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.

Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
```js
Example 1:
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
```
#### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
* -231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1

```js
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isValidBST = function(root) {
  const recursion = (root, left, right) => {
    if(!root) return true;

    if((left !== null && root.val <= left) || (right !== null && root.val >= right)) return false;

    return recursion(root.left, left, root.val) && recursion(root.right, root.val, right);
  }

  return recursion(root, null, null)
};
```
