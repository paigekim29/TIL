## 944. Delete Columns to Make Sorted

You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.

The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid. For example, strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"] can be arranged as:
```js
abc
bce
cae
```
You want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically. In the above example (0-indexed), columns 0 ('a', 'b', 'c') and 2 ('c', 'e', 'e') are sorted while column 1 ('b', 'c', 'a') is not, so you would delete column 1.

Return the number of columns that you will delete.

```js
Example 1:
Input: strs = ["cba","daf","ghi"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The grid looks as follows:
cba
daf
ghi
Columns 0 and 2 are sorted, but column 1 is not, so you only need to delete 1 column.

Example 2:
Input: strs = ["a","b"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The grid looks as follows:
a
b
Column 0 is the only column and is sorted, so you will not delete any columns.
    
Example 3:
Input: strs = ["zyx","wvu","tsr"]
Output: 3
Explanation: The grid looks as follows:
zyx
wvu
tsr
All 3 columns are not sorted, so you will delete all 3.
```
#### Constraints:

* n == strs.length
* 1 <= n <= 100
* 1 <= strs[i].length <= 1000
* strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

```js
/**
 * @param {string[]} strs
 * @return {number}
 */
var minDeletionSize = function(strs) {
  let answer = 0;
  let strLength = strs[0].length;
  
  for(let i = 0; i < strLength; i++){
    for(let j = 0; j < strs.length - 1; j++){
      if(strs[j][i] > strs[j + 1][i]){ // Checking each column's value
        answer ++;
        break; 
        // Once previous column's value is bigger than current column's value, no need to check further
      }
    }
  }

  return answer
};
```
## Make an Array
i.
* 2n + 1 length
* composed with random integers
* range of [-100, 200]  
  
ii.
* non-repetitive integers
  
iii.
* composed with elements that repeat twice, except one element

```js
function solution(n){
  let length = n + 1;
  let arr =  new Array(length); 

  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    arr[i] = Math.round(Math.random() * 300) - 100;
    // Math.random() generates random number from 0 to 1
    // Even though range is '-100' to '200', it is easier to think the start point as '0' and then
    // find the total possible range of numbers => (200 - (-100) = 300)
    // Once the random number is generated, the start point can be moved from 0 to -100 as it required 
  }

  let set = new Set(arr); // Allows to ignore any duplicate number(ii)

  while(set.size !== arr.length){ 
    // Need to use Set.prototype.size and Set.prototype.add unlike Array.prototype.length and Array.prototype.push
    set.add(Math.round(Math.random() * 300) - 100);
  }

  let answer = [...set];
  // Spread Syntax to make an Array from Set
  // Other mehtods = Array.from() or Set.prototype.forEach()
  
  answer = [...answer, ...answer.slice(0, -1)] 
  // Which allows to duplicate all elements of the Array twice except 1

  for(let i = 0; i < answer.length; i++){
    let j = Math.round(Math.random() * 2 * n); 
    // Length of Array is 2n + 1, so index should be 0 to 2n
    [answer[i], answer[j]] = [answer[j], answer[i]]
    // Destructuring allows to shuffle elements inside the Array
  }

  return answer;
}
```
