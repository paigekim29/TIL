## 1441. Build an Array With Stack Operations

Given an array target and an integer n. In each iteration, you will read a number from  list = {1,2,3..., n}.

Build the target array using the following operations:

* Push: Read a new element from the beginning list, and push it in the array.
* Pop: delete the last element of the array.
* If the target array is already built, stop reading more elements.

Return the operations to build the target array. You are guaranteed that the answer is unique.
```js
Example 1:
Input: target = [1,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]
Explanation:
Read number 1 and automatically push in the array -> [1]
Read number 2 and automatically push in the array then Pop it -> [1]
Read number 3 and automatically push in the array -> [1,3]

Example 2:
Input: target = [1,2,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Push"]

Example 3:
Input: target = [1,2], n = 4
Output: ["Push","Push"]
Explanation: You only need to read the first 2 numbers and stop.
    
Example 4:
Input: target = [2,3,4], n = 4
Output: ["Push","Pop","Push","Push","Push"]
```
```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} target
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var buildArray = function(target, n) {
    let answer = [];
    
    let i = 0;
    let num = 1;
    
    while(num <= n){
        if(i === target.length) return answer; 
        // To get out of while loop once it iterates target array
        else if(target[i] === num){
          // Once it matches, it tells that "Push" should be inserted
            answer.push("Push");
            i++;
        }else{
          // If it does not match, it means the number has been pushed and popped
            answer = [...answer, "Push", "Pop"]
        }
        
        num ++; // Always adds up number during while loop
    }

    return answer;
};

```



Constraints:

1 <= target.length <= 100
1 <= target[i] <= n
1 <= n <= 100
target is strictly increasing.
